In this repository ,I have implemented a Calorie Prediction model using machine learning,extracting data from the 2 csv files for calories and exercise which have information about a persons Age,height,weight,Body Temperature and Heart rate.
I have used XGB Regressor as a model to make predictions.
At the end I have made a predictive system where you give Gender,Age,Height,weight,Duration of exercise,Heart_rate,Body temp and you get no of calories as output
